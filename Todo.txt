// TODO [handleFeedFollows.go]:
	// when we try to delete in sql and query condition doesn't holds true,
	// it deletes nothing from db, but returns success query execution
	// due to this we do not get to know if it really deleted the record...
	// so that's why we need to count the pre-delete records and post-delete records
	// and if they are equal, means no delete happend and we can send err to client
